After creating the Dockerfile we run:
docker build -t gbrom/tp1 .
To build the image

Create the network with:
docker network create app-network

Question 1.1: For which reason is it better to run the container with a flag -e to give the environment variables rather than put them directly in the Dockerfile?

Questions 1.2 Why do we need a volume to be attached to our postgres container?

To make sure we save our data in case data in our db gets deleted

Question 1.3: Document your database container essentials: commands and Dockerfile.

This command runs our image in the background, with the name postgres and password=mysecretpassword as well as a volume to save data.
docker run -d --name postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -v C:\my\own\datadir:/var/lib/postgresql/data postgres

Our Dockerfile defines the use of postgres db
